The initial implementation of the Methodic Tasks & Goals task and goal management application. This first iteration of this application will be heavily influenced by Wunderlist, the application that Tasks & Goals is replacing in the Methodic workflow. Ultimately this project, along side similar projects, will act as the precursors for the Methodic Microservice Ecosystem (MME).
